# React Chat & Sessions Boilerplate

A quick React chat forum boilerplate with a Node and Express server implementing basic sessions.

To start using this boilerplate, fork this project.

Then click on "Clone or download" and copy the repository link.

Open your terminal window on your computer and navigate to an area where you would like this project saved.

Type ```git clone [the repository url you copied]```. Example on next line.

It should look something like this, ```git clone https://github.com/ericdfanning/ChatsAndSessions.git```. Except instead of 'ericdfanning', it will show the name of your github profile.

Once it is done cloning, type ```cd ChatsAndSessions``` to go into the project folder.

If using node,type ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies this project needs in order to work.

Then to start the server on your local machine, type ```npm start``` into your terminal window. If it starts without error it should say "now listening on port 3304".

Now in your web browser, open a new window or tab and navigate to [localhost:3304] to see your boilerplate React web app displayed!
